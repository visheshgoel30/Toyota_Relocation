# Toyota_Relocation
"The relocation of Toyota Motor Company from California to North Texas (Plano)"

**Key Deliverables **

1) The successful move from Torrance to Plano and checking the brand value attached to the company while making a move.
2) A labor report of the market showing the local talent available and comparable compensation
3) A report/presentation for current employees focused on the region's economics that shows the real estate market, local inflation, and school ratings.
4) A report showing the tax break from the state/country and subsidized access to utilities
5) It presents the ease of connectivity with the other parts of the country and explains Texas's local transportation facilities.

**Key Milestones ** 

Planning the entire project and finally drafting out the flow of how the project will move forward is the primary step. It would also involve the various ifs and buts raised by the major stakeholders or the key company representatives. Taking care of the funding, site location, having appropriate consultants on board, and securing the client approvals are initial steps.
Once all of this has taken place effectively, would the milestones fall in line as follows:
- Collecting approval from the Texas State government for setting up the plant.
- The people responsible for the setup and delivery of the new plant must be hired to take care of all the design, construction, painting, flooring, etc.
- Setting up all the wiring and the required networks is essential for any company. It would also ensure keeping everything from the previous plant and adding on to some   additional requirements as demanded or suggested by the IT professionals.
- Ensuring a secure environment for the employees and setting up all the essential security systems.
- Reviewing the site and rectifying it if needed.
- Setting up and choosing a smooth path for shifting the items from the old plant to the new one.
- Ensuring all the goods have been adequately relocated and replacing the ones that may have been damaged during the process to mark the shifting process finally.
