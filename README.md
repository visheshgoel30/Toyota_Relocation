# Toyota_Relocation
“The relocation of Toyota Motor Company from California to North Texas (Plano)”

**Key Deliverables **
1. Successfully moving from Torrance to Plano and keeping in check the brand value attached to the company while making the move.
2. A labor report of the market showing the local talent available and comparable compensation
3. A report/presentation for current employees focusing on the economics of the region that show the real estate market, local inflation, and school ratings.
4. A report showing the tax break from the state/country and subsidized access to utilities
5. Presentation on the ease of connectivity with the other parts of the country and explaining the local transportation facilities available in Texas.

**Key Milestones **
Planning the entire project and finally drafting out the flow of how the project will move forward is the basic step. This would also involve the various if's and but's that may be raised by the major stakeholders or the key company representatives. Taking care of the funding, site location, having appropriate consultants on board, and securing the client approvals are initial steps to it.

Once all of this has taken place effectively would the milestones fall in line as follows: 
1. Approval from the Texas State government for setting up the plant.
2. The people responsible for the setup and delivery of the new plant must be hired which will take care of all the design, construction, painting, flooring, etc.
3. Setting up all the wiring and the required networks essential for any company. This would also ensure keeping all the things from the previous plant and adding on to some extra requirements as demanded or suggested by the IT professionals.
4. Ensuring a secure environment for the employees and setting up all the essential security systems for the same.
5. Reviewing the site and rectifying it if needed.
6. Setting up and choosing a smooth path for shifting the items from the old plant to the new one.
7. Making sure that all the goods have been properly relocated and replacing the ones that may have been damaged during the process to finally mark the shifting process complete.
